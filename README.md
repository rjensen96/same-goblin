# same-goblin

There was a game on some old version of Linux that I used to play called Same Gnome. It was like some ancient ancestor of Candy Crush. Anyway, I loved that game, so I wanted to re-implement something like it. Welcome to Same Goblin!

Live version of the game here: https://rjensen96.github.io/samegoblin/#/

The old Same Gnome had some retro images of Jupiter, Earth, and the Moon. If you want those instead, maybe grab those and do a pull request.

Everything is basic html/css underneath the Vue components (no canvas or drawing library).
